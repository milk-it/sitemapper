= Sitemapper - Easy SEO engine

Sitemapper will help you in various SEO techniques such as sitemap.xml
auto generation.

== Installation

  You can install the development version with

  % sudo gem install milk-it-sitemapper -s http://gems.github.com

  Or the release version with

  % sudo gem install sitemapper


== Examples

=== Ruby On Rails

Sitemapper will automagically generate a sitemap.xml file for you when
your rails application start, this sitemap.xml will include all your
URLs that Sitemapper consider 'static', for example:

  map.todo '/to-do' # Sitemapper will consider this as static
  map.articles '/articles/:year/:month' # Will be considered this dynamic
  map.connect '*path' # Will be considered dynamic

The generation of your sitemap.xml will happen on your application boot,
but it won't delete any URL previous added (we hope to be able to do so
very soon - a merge).

In your application, you can use the accessors provided by Sitemapper to
dynamically add URLs, for example, supose a blog app:

  class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
    ...
    def create
      # do all the creation stuff
      map_url(article_url(@article)) # add the URL to your sitemap
    end

    def destroy
      # do all the deletion stuff
      unmap_url(article_url(@article))
    end
    ...
  end

You can also do it on your sweepers (which is a better choice)

  class ArticleSweeper < ActionController::Caching::Sweeper
    observe Article, Account

    def after_create(record)
      # expire everything you need
      map_url(polymorphic_url(record))
    end

    def after_destroy(record)
      # expire everything you need
      map_url(polymorphic_url(record))
    end
  end

=== Merb

Sorry, we do not support Merb yet. (Actually, it will depend on the
demand)

=== Other SEO techniques

With SEO, you'll have some view helpers to easily apply some SEO
techniques to your website/webapp.

In your application layout, just do it:

  <head>
      <%= title('My Personal Blog') %>
      <%= page_meta %>
  </head>

And in your action views, you put this:

  <% page(:title => 'Contact',
    :desc => 'Here you'll can contact our customer support ...',
    :keywords => 'contact, support, customer') %>

In this case, the view will be rendered in this way:

  <head>
      <title>Contact :: My Personal Blog</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Here you'll can contact our customer support ..." />
      <meta name="keywords" content="contact, support, customer" />
  </head>

If you want to change the title separator, just do:

    ...
    <%= title('My Personal Blog', :separator => ' - ') %>
    ...

Or, you can als use any object that respond to title or name (for
page title), short_description or description, tag_list or keywords.

  <% page(@event) %>

=== Hope you enjoy!

== To do:

 * Add sitemap options to routes
 * Create separate files for dynamic and static routes (then, we'll can
   delete all the static on startup)
 * Write test code (sorry, I really didn't it)
